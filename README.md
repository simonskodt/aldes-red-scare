# Red Scare

This repository contains the implementation of various algorithmic paradigms for 
the mandatory assignment in Algorithm Design. The focus is on choosing and utilizing 
well-known algorithmic paradigms, rather than implementing them from scratch.

## How to Run

To ensure you have the necessary dependencies, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All the programs for solving different problems are organized into separate classes 
under the `problems` directory.

To generate the `results.txt` file, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --all
```

This command will create the result file.

If you wish to run the programs on a specific file, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --file FILENAME
```

For a comprehensive description of available options, refer to the help command:

```bash
python main.py --help
```
